### Project Overview

 The project basically involves census record management and data analysis on the given dataset. The dataset which has been provided has details of 100 people with the following 8 features: age, education-num, race, sex, capital-gain, capital loss, hours-per-week and income respectively.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have got better grip on working with NumPy libray which includes large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.


### Challenges faced

 The concept of 'subsetting the array' was quite challenging for me at a particular period of time.
